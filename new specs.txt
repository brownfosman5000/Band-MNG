we have user create a band 

just name for now

then we assign shows to that band with dates and times

eventually want to delete shows from that band
	-so need a page from the links of the bands to dipslay all shows
	Ex.
		Band 1 - links to a bunch of shows for this particular band
		Band 2 - links to a bunch of shows for this particular band
			- Can we get our band to retrieve the shows??
				So they connect between primary and foreign key
				-On this page delete button next to show 
				when clicked it says show deleted successfully

we also want to edit
	-make a page that displays all links to bands to display all shows
		-already have
	have buttons next to each link in band and show-delete and edit
	delete button links to delete successful page and when we return the band should be deleted
